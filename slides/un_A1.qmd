-   We consider data for $n = 203$ models of cars in circulation in 1985
    in the USA.
-   We want to [predict]{.blue} the distance per unit of
    fuel, as a function of the vehicle features.
-   We consider the following [variables]{.orange}:
    -   The city distance per unit of fuel (km/L, `city.distance`)
    -   The engine size (L, `engine.size`)
    -   The number of cylinders (`n.cylinders`)
    -   The curb weight (kg, `curb.weight`)
    -   The fuel type (gasoline or diesel, `fuel`).

-   Let us consider the variables `city.distance` ($y$), `engine.size` ($x$) and `fuel`
    ($z$).

-   A [simple linear regression]{.blue} $$
    Y_i = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x_i + \epsilon_i, \qquad i=1,\dots,n,
    $$ could be easily fit by least squares...

-   ... but the plot clearly suggests that the relationship between
    `city.distance` and `engine.size` is [not]{.orange} well
    approximated by a [linear]{.orange} function.

-   ... and also that `fuel` has an non-negligible effect on the
    response.
:::
:::

## Regression models

::: incremental
-   A [general]{.orange} and [more flexible formulation]{.orange} for modeling the relationship
    between a vector of [fixed covariates]{.blue}
    $(x_{i1},\dots,x_{ip})^T \in \mathbb{R}^p$ and a random variable
    $Y_i \in \mathbb{R}$ is $$
    Y_i = f(x_{i1},\dots,x_{ip}; \beta) + \epsilon_i, \qquad i=1,\dots,n,
    $$
    where the "errors" $\epsilon_i$ are iid random variables, having
    zero mean and variance $\sigma^2$.

-   To estimate the unknown parameters $\beta$, a possibility is to rely
    on the [least squares criterion]{.blue}: we seek the
    [minimum]{.orange} of the objective function $$
    D(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n\{y_i - f(x_{i1},\dots, x_{ip}; \beta)\}^2,
    $$ using $n$ pairs of covariates $(x_{i1},\dots,x_{ip})^T$ and
    the observed realizations $y_i$ of the random variables $Y_i$, for $i = 1,\dots,n$. The [optimal value]{.orange} is denoted by $\hat{\beta}$.

-   The [predicted values]{.blue} $\hat{y}_i$ are 
    $\hat{y}_i = \mathbb{E}(Y_i) = f(x_{i1},\dots,x_{ip}; \hat{\beta})$, for
    $i=1,\dots,n.$
:::

## Linear models

-   Let us consider again the variables `city.distance` ($y$), `engine.size`
    ($x$) and `fuel` ($z$).

- Which function $f(x,z;\beta)$ should we choose?

. . .

-   A first attempt is to consider a [polynomial term]{.orange}
    combined with a [dummy variable]{.blue} $$
    f(x, z; \beta) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x + \beta_3 x^2 + \beta_4 x^3 + \beta_5 I(z = \texttt{gas}),
    $$
which is a special instance of [linear model]{.orange}.

. . .

::: callout-note
#### Definition (Linear model)

In a [linear model]{.blue} the response variable is related to the
covariates through the function$$
    f(x_1,\dots,x_p; \beta) = \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p = \tilde{\bm{x}}^T\beta,
    $$ where $\tilde{\bm{x}} = (x_1, \dots,x_p)^T$ is a vector of
[covariates]{.orange} and $\beta = (\beta_1,\dots,\beta_p)^T$ is the
corresponding vector of [coefficients]{.orange}.
:::

## Matrix notation

::: incremental
-   The [response random variables]{.orange} are collected in the random vector $\bm{Y} = (Y_1,\dots,Y_n)^T$, whose [observed realization]{.blue} is $\bm{y} = (y_1,\dots,y_n)^T$.

-   The [design matrix]{.blue} is a $n \times p$ matrix, comprising the
    covariate's values, defined by $$
    \bm{X} = 
    \begin{bmatrix} 
    x_{11} & \cdots & x_{1p}\\
    \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    x_{n1} & \cdots & x_{np}
    \end{bmatrix}.
    $$

-   Then, a [linear model]{.blue} can be written using the [compact
    notation]{.orange}: $$
    \bm{Y} = \bm{X}\beta + \bm{\epsilon},
    $$ where $\bm{\epsilon} = (\epsilon_1,\dots,\epsilon_n)^T$ is a
    vector of iid error terms with zero mean and variance $\sigma^2$.

-   The $j$th variable (column) is denoted with $\bm{x}_j$, whereas the
    $i$th observation (row) is $\tilde{\bm{x}}_i$: $$
    \bm{X} = (\bm{x}_1,\dots,\bm{x}_p) = (\tilde{\bm{x}}_1, \dots,\tilde{\bm{x}}_n)^T.
    $$
:::

## Linear regression: estimation I

-   The optimal set of coefficients $\hat{\beta}$ is the minimizer of
    the [least squared criterion]{.orange} $$
    D(\beta) = (\bm{y} - \bm{X}\beta)^T(\bm{y} - \bm{X}\beta) = ||\bm{y} - \bm{X}\beta||^2,
    $$ known also as [residual sum of squares (RSS)]{.orange}, where $$
    ||\bm{y}|| = \sqrt{y_1^2 + \cdots + y_n^2},$$
    denotes the [Euclidean norm]{.blue}.

. . .

::: callout-note
#### Least square estimate (OLS)

If the design matrix has [full rank]{.blue}, that is if
$\text{rk}(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}) = p$, then the [least square
estimate]{.orange} has an explicit solution: $$
    \hat{\beta} = (\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1}\bm{X}^T \bm{y}.
    $$
:::

## Linear regression: estimation II

::: incremental
-   In matrix notation, the predicted values are can be obtained as $$
    \hat{\bm{y}} = \bm{X}\hat{\beta} = \bm{H}\bm{y}, \qquad \bm{H} = \bm{X}(\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1}\bm{X}^T.
    $$

-   $\bm{H}$ is a $n \times n$ [projection matrix]{.orange} matrix
    sometimes called [hat matrix]{.blue}.

-   It can be shown that $\text{tr}(\bm{H}) = \text{rk}(\bm{H}) = p$.
    Moreover, it holds $\bm{H} = \bm{H}^T$ and $\bm{H}^2 = \bm{H}$.

-   The quantity $D(\hat{\beta})$ is the so-called [deviance]{.blue}, which is
    equal to $$
    D(\hat{\beta}) = ||\bm{y} - \hat{\bm{y}}||^2 = \bm{y}^T(I_n - \bm{H})\bm{y}.
    $$

-   A typical estimate for the [residual variance]{.orange} $\sigma^2$
    is then given by $$
    s^2 = \frac{D(\hat{\beta})}{n - p} = \frac{1}{n-p}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \tilde{\bm{x}}_i^T\hat{\beta})^2.
    $$
:::

## Linear regression: inference

::: incremental
-   Let us additionally assume that the errors follow a Gaussian
    distribution:
    $\epsilon_i \overset{\text{iid}}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2)$.

-   This implies that the [distribution]{.orange} of the [estimator]{.orange} $\hat{\beta}$ is
    $$
    \hat{\beta} \sim N_p(\beta, \sigma^2 (\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1}).
    $$

-   Hence, the estimator $\hat{\beta}$ is [unbiased]{.orange} and its
    [variance]{.blue} can be estimated by $$
    \widehat{\text{var}}(\hat{\beta}) = s^2 (\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1}.
    $$

-   The [standard errors]{.orange} of the components of beta correspond
    to the square root of the diagonal of the above covariance matrix.

-   Confidence interval and Wald's tests can be obtained through
    classical inferential theory.
    
- Ok, we are ready to get back to the original problem...
:::

## Car data, a first model

::: incremental
-   Our first attempt for predicting `city.distance` ($y$) via `engine.size`
    ($x$) and `fuel` ($z$) is: $$
      f(x, z; \beta) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x + \beta_3 x^2 + \beta_4 x^3 + \beta_5 I(z = \texttt{gas}).
      $$

-   Indeed, by looking at the plot of the data, it is plausible that we need a
    [polynomial]{.orange} of degree $3$ or $4$

-   It is also clear from the plot that `fuel` is a relevant variable.
    Categorical variables are [encoded]{.orange} using [indicator
    variables]{.blue}.

-   To evaluate the goodness of fit, we can calculate the [coefficient
    of determination]{.orange}: $$
    R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{(``Residual deviance'')}}{\text{(``Total deviance'')}} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \bar{y})^2}.
    $$
:::

## A first model: estimated coefficients

-   We obtain the following [summary]{.orange} for the regression
    coefficients $\hat{\beta}$.

```{r}
library(broom)
library(knitr)
m1 <- lm(city.distance ~ engine.size + I(engine.size^2) + I(engine.size^3) + fuel, data = auto)
kable(tidy(m1, conf.int = FALSE), digits = 3)
```

-   Moreover, the coefficient $R^2$ and the residual standard deviation $s$ are:

```{r}
kable(glance(m1)[c(1, 3, 10)])
```

## A first model: fitted values

```

## Comments and criticisms

::: incremental

- Is this a good model?

-   The overall fit [seems satisfactory]{.blue} at first glance,
    especially if we aim at predicting the urban distance of cars when
    average engine size (i.e., between $1.5L$ and $3L$).

-   However, the plot of the [residuals]{.orange}
    $r_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$ suggests that there the homoschedasticity
    assumption, i.e. $\text{var}(\epsilon_i) = \sigma^2$, might be
    violated.

-   Also, this model in not suitable for [extrapolation]{.orange}. Indeed:
    -   It has no grounding in physics or engineering, which leads to
    difficulties in the interpretation of the trend and/or paradoxical
    situations.
    -   For example, the curve of the set of gasoline cars shows a local
    minimum around $4.6 L$ and then rises again!
    
-  It is plausible that we can find a better one, so what's next?
:::

## Linear models and non-linear patterns

-   A major advantage of linear models is that they can describe
    non-linear relationship via [variable transformations]{.blue} such as polynomials, logarithms, etc.

. . .

-   This gives the statistician a lot of modelling flexibility. For
    instance we could let: $$
\log{Y_i} = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \log{x_i} + \beta_3 I(z_i = \texttt{gas}) + \epsilon_i, \qquad i=1,\dots,n.
$$

. . .

-   This specification is [linear in the parameters]{.orange}, it fixes
    the domain issues, and it imposes a monotone relationship between
    engine size and consumption.

. . .

```{r}
m2 <- lm(log(city.distance) ~ I(log(engine.size)) + fuel, data = auto)
kable(tidy(m2, conf.int = FALSE), digits = 3)
```

## Second model: fitted values

```{r}
#| fig-width: 7.8
#| fig-height: 4.55
#| fig-align: center
augmented_m2 <- augment(m2, data = auto)
ggplot(data = augmented_m2, aes(x = engine.size, y = city.distance, col = fuel)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y = exp(.fitted))) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  scale_color_tableau(palette = "Color Blind") +
  xlab("Engine size (L)") +
  ylab("Urban distance (km/L)")
```

## Second model: graphical diagnostics

```{r}
#| fig-width: 7.8
#| fig-height: 4.55
#| fig-align: center
ggplot(data = augmented_m2, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid, col = fuel)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), linetype = "dotted") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  scale_color_tableau(palette = "Color Blind") +
  xlab("Fitted values") +
  ylab("Residuals")
```

## Comments and criticisms

-   The [goodness of fit]{.blue} indices are the following:

```{r}
r.squared.original <- 1 - sum(mean((auto$city.distance - exp(predict(m2)))^2)) / sum(mean((auto$city.distance - mean(auto$city.distance))^2))
kable(data.frame(r.squared.original = r.squared.original, glance(m2)[c(1, 3, 10)]))
```

-   Do not mix [apple]{.blue} and [oranges]{.orange}! Compare $R^2$s only if they refer to the same scale!

. . .

-   This second model is [more parsimonious]{.blue} and yet it reaches
    satisfactory predictive performance.

-   It is also more coherent with the nature of the data: the
    predictions cannot be negative and the relationship between engine
    size and the consumption is monotone.

-   Yet, there is still some heteroschedasticity in the residuals --- is this
    due to a missing covariate that has not been included into the
    model?

## A third model: additional variables

-   Let us consider [two additional variables]{.blue}: `curb.weight`
    ($w$) and `n.cylinders` ($v$). 
    
- A richer model therefore could be: $$
\log{Y_i} = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \log{x_i} +  \beta_3 \log{w_i} + \beta_4 I(z_i = \texttt{gas}) + \beta_5 I(v_i = 2) + \epsilon_i,
    $$ for $i=1,\dots,n$. The estimates are:

. . .

```{r}
auto$cylinders2 <- factor(auto$n.cylinders == 2)
m3 <- lm(log(city.distance) ~ I(log(engine.size)) + I(log(curb.weight)) + fuel + cylinders2, data = auto)
kable(tidy(m3, conf.int = FALSE), digits = 3)
```

## A third model: graphical diagnostics

```{r}
#| fig-width: 7.8
#| fig-height: 4.55
#| fig-align: center
augmented_m3 <- augment(m3, data = auto)
ggplot(data = augmented_m3, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid, col = fuel)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), linetype = "dotted") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  scale_color_tableau(palette = "Color Blind") +
  xlab("Fitted values") +
  ylab("Residuals")
```

## Comments and criticisms

-   The goodness of fit greatly [improved]{.blue}:

```{r}
r.squared.original <- 1 - sum(mean((auto$city.distance - exp(predict(m3)))^2)) / sum(mean((auto$city.distance - mean(auto$city.distance))^2))
kable(data.frame(r.squared.original = r.squared.original, glance(m3)[c(1, 3, 10)]))
```

-   In this third model, we took care of the [outliers]{.orange} appearing in the residual plots, which it turns out are identified by the group of cars having 2 cylinders.

-   The diagnostic plots are also very much improved, although still not perfect.

-   The estimates are coherent with our expectations, based on common
    knowledge. Have a look at the textbook (A&S) for a detailed
    explaination about $\beta_4$!
    
- If you are curious, the car dataset is available from the textbook (A\&S) website:

# Cholesky factorization

## How to obtain the least squares estimate?

-   In B.Sc. courses it is often suggested that the least square
    estimate should be computed using the formula $$
    \hat{\beta} = (\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1}\bm{X}^T \bm{y},
    $$ that is, using the R code `solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% y`.

-   This approach works reasonably
    well in many [simple cases]{.blue}.

. . .

-   Unfortunately, in more challenging scenarios, e.g. when we have a lot of data (large
    $n$) and correlated variables, the above code is 
     - [computationally
    inefficient]{.orange}
     - [numerically inaccurate]{.blue}

-   The main computational bottleneck is the calculation of the inverse of
    $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$, which is very costly and often numerically
    unstable, especially when the predictors are almost collinear.

## The normal equations

-   The least square estimate is the solution of the system of equations ([normal
    equations]{.orange}):$$
    \bm{X}^T\bm{X} \beta = \bm{X}^T \bm{y}.
    $$

-   This system could be solved using
    `solve(crossprod(X), crossprod(X, y))`.

-   This avoids the explicit computation of
    $(\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1}$ and it is preferable compared to the "direct
    solution". However, it does not exploit the properties of the matrix
    $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$.

. . .


. . .

-   Recall (from your favorite linear algebra textbook) that a
    [symmetric]{.blue} matrix $\bm{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$ is
    [positive definite]{.orange} if and only if one the following
    properties is satisfied
    -   The quadratic form $\tilde{\bm{x}}^T \bm{A} \tilde{\bm{x}} > 0$ for all
        $\tilde{\bm{x}} \in \mathbb{R}^p$ such that $\tilde{\bm{x}} \neq 0$.
    -   The eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_p$ of $\bm{A}$ are all
        strictly positive.

- We now describe a strategy to compute $\hat{\beta}$ that exploits the fact that $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ is [positive definite]{.orange}, resulting in more [efficient computations]{.blue}. 

## Cholesky factorization


::: callout-note
#### Proposition A.1

Suppose $\bm{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ with $n \ge p$ has full
rank, that is $\text{rk}(\bm{X}) = p$. Then, the matrix $$
\bm{X}^T\bm{X}
$$ is [symmetric]{.blue} and [positive definite]{.orange}.
:::

. . .

::: callout-note
#### Theorem (Cholesky factorization)

Let $\bm{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$ be a symmetric and positive
definite matrix. Then, there exists a unique [upper triangular]{.orange}
$p \times p$ matrix $\bm{R}$ with positive entries such that $$
\bm{A} = \bm{R}^T\bm{R}.
$$
:::

## Cholesky factorization and least squares

::: incremental

- The Cholesky factorization is incredibly helpful for computing least squares. Indeed:

-   Let $\bm{R}^T\bm{R}$ be the Cholesky factorization of the matrix
    $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$. Then, the [normal equations]{.orange} can be
    written as $$
    \bm{R}^T\bm{R} \beta = \bm{X}^T \bm{y}.
    $$ This system be can now solved in [two steps]{.orange}:

-   [Step 1 (Forwardsolve)]{.blue}. Solve with respect to $z$ the system
    of equations $$
    \bm{R}^T z = \bm{X}^T \bm{y}.
    $$

-   [Step 2 (Backsolve)]{.blue}. Given $z$, now solve with respect to
    $\beta$ the system of equations $$
    \bm{R} \beta = z.
    $$
- Why is this procedure computationally more efficient than the naïve solution?
:::

## Forward and backward substitutions

::: incremental
-   The key observation is that the solution of [triangular systems]{.blue} is computationally 
    [straightforward]{.orange}.

-   As an example, consider the following $3 \times 3$ lower triangular
    system: $$
    \begin{bmatrix} 
    l_{11} & 0 & 0 \\
    l_{21} & l_{22} & 0 \\
    l_{31} & l_{32} & l_{33} \\
    \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3
    \end{bmatrix}.
    $$

-   The solution for $x_1,x_2,x_3$ can be found sequentially: $$
    x_1 = \frac{b_1}{l_{11}}, \qquad x_2 = \frac{b_2 -  l_{21}x_1}{l_{22}}, \qquad x_3 = \frac{b_3 - l_{31}x_1 - l_{32}x_2}{l_{33}}.
    $$

-   Finding the [inverse]{.orange} $\bm{R}^{-1}$ is simple, again because $\bm{R}$
    is upper triangular. Also note that $$
    (\bm{X}^T \bm{X})^{-1} = (\bm{R}^T \bm{R})^{-1} = \bm{R}^{-1} (\bm{R}^{-1})^T.
    $$
:::

## Computational complexity

-   The solution via Cholesky factorization is a [fast direct
    approach]{.blue} for finding $\hat{\beta}$.

-   The expensive steps are:

    -   The formation of the matrix $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ requires
        $\sim n p^2$ elementary operations
    -   The Cholesky factorization of $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ requires
        $\sim p^3 / 3$ elementary operations.

-   This gives an overall computational complexity of order $$
    \sim n p^2 + p^3 /3,
    $$ which corrects the typographical error of the A&S textbook.

-   This means, unfortunately, that in [high-dimensional]{.blue} settings (large $p$)
    computations become [very costly]{.orange}, since the
    complexity is cubic in $p$.

## ☠️ - Error propagation in normal equations

::: incremental
-   The normal equations method is typically [quicker]{.blue} than other
    algorithms, as it removes the dependency on $n$, but it is in
    general numerically more [unstable]{.orange}.

-   Consider for example the following matrix: $$
    \bm{X} = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 \\
    \epsilon & 0 \\
    0 & \epsilon \end{bmatrix},
    $$ for a small value $\epsilon > 0$. Then, we obtain that
    $$\bm{X}^T \bm{X} = \begin{bmatrix}1 + \epsilon^2& 1 \\
    1 & 1 + \epsilon^2 \end{bmatrix}.
    $$

-   The numerical computation of $\epsilon^2$ in $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$
    requires a higher precision compared to $\epsilon$, leading to
    numerical instabilities and/or a [loss in accuracy]{.orange}.
:::

## ☠️ - Condition numbers and normal equations

::: incremental
-   Suppose $\bm{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ with $n \ge p$ has full
    rank and singular values $d_1 \ge d_2 \ge \dots \ge d_p$. Then its
    [condition number]{.orange} is $$
    \kappa(\bm{X}) = ||\bm{X}|| \cdot ||\bm{X}^+|| = \frac{d_1}{d_p},
    $$ where $\bm{X}^+$ is the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse. Note that
    $\kappa(\bm{X}) \ge 1$.

-   If $\kappa(\bm{X})$ is small, the matrix $\bm{X}$ is [well
    conditioned]{.blue}. Otherwise, we say it is [ill
    conditioned]{.orange}.

-   The condition number determines how accurately we can solve linear
    systems.

-   An important fact is: $$
    \kappa(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}) = \kappa(\bm{X})^2, 
    $$ implying that there is a clear loss of numerical accuracy when
    using normal equations.

# The QR decomposition

## Orthogonal predictors

- Another approach for computing least squares is based on the notion of orthogonality. 

. . .

-   If the [predictors]{.blue} were mutually [orthogonal]{.orange}, the
    problem would be much simpler.

-   In other words, consider a linear model of the form $$
    \bm{Y} = \bm{Z}\bm{\beta} + \bm{\epsilon},
    $$ where $\bm{Z} = (\bm{z}_1,\dots,\bm{z}_p)$.
    [Orthogonality]{.orange} means that
    $\bm{Z}^T\bm{Z} = \text{diag}(\bm{z}_1^T\bm{z}_1,\dots,\bm{z}_p^T\bm{z}_p)$.

. . .

::: callout-note
#### Proposition A.2. OLS with orthogonal predictors

The least square estimate
$\hat{\bm{\beta}} = (\hat{\beta}_1,\dots,\hat{\beta}_p)^T$ of a linear
model with orthogonal predictors is

$$
\hat{\gamma}_j = \frac{\bm{z}_j^T\bm{y}}{\bm{z}_j^T\bm{z}_j}, \qquad j=1,\dots,p.
$$
:::

## Regression by successive orthogonalization
::: incremental
-   Clearly, the predictors of $\bm{X}$ are generally not orthogonal. Hence, we want to
    find a suitable transformation $\bm{Z} = \bm{X} \bm{\Gamma}^{-1}$
    that [orthogonalize]{.blue} the [predictors]{.orange}.


-   Suppose for example that $p = 2$. We set [first orthogonal
    predictor]{.orange} $\bm{z}_1 = \bm{x}_1$.

-   We then consider the following [univariate]{.blue} regression
    problem $$
    \bm{x}_2 = \gamma \bm{z}_1 + \bm{\epsilon}, \qquad \text{which leads} \qquad \hat{\gamma} = \frac{\bm{z}_1^T\bm{x}_2}{\bm{z}_1^T\bm{z}_1}.
    $$

-   The [second orthogonal predictor]{.orange} is obtained as the
    [residual term]{.blue}: $$
    \bm{z}_2 = \bm{x}_2 - \hat{\gamma}\bm{z}_1.
    $$

-   The geometry of linear models guarantees that
    $\bm{z}_1^T\bm{z}_2 = 0$.
:::

## Gram-Schmidt algorithm
::: incremental
-   Let us now consider the [general case]{.orange}, valid for any value of
    $p$.

-   [Initialization]{.blue}. Set $\bm{z}_1 = \bm{x}_1$.

-   [For $j= 2,\dots,p$]{.blue}. Consider the regression problem with
    $j-1$ orthogonal predictors $$
    \bm{x}_j = \sum_{k=1}^{j-1}\gamma_{kj} \bm{z}_k + \bm{\epsilon}_j, \quad \text{which leads} \quad \hat{\gamma}_{kj} = \frac{\bm{z}_k^T\bm{x}_j}{\bm{z}_k^T\bm{z}_k}, \quad k=1,\dots,j-1,
    $$ Then, compute the new vector $\bm{z}_j$ as the
    [residual]{.orange} term $$
    \bm{z}_j = \bm{x}_j - \sum_{k=1}^{j-1}\hat{\gamma}_{kj} \bm{z}_k
    $$

-   The geometry of linear models guarantees [orthogonality]{.orange},
    that is $\bm{z}_j^T \bm{z}_{j'} = 0$ for any $j \neq j'$.
:::

## The QR decomposition I

::: incremental
-   By construction, the Gram-Schmidt algorithm produces the following
    decomposition $$
    \bm{X} = \bm{Z} \bm{\Gamma}, \qquad \bm{\Gamma} = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & \hat{\gamma}_{12} & \hat{\gamma}_{13} &\cdots & \hat{\gamma}_{1p} \\
    0 &  1 & \hat{\gamma}_{23} &\cdots & \hat{\gamma}_{2p} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots &\ddots & \vdots\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1
    \end{bmatrix}, \qquad \bm{Z} = (\bm{z}_1,\dots,\bm{z}_p).
    $$

-   The $p \times p$ matrix $\bm{\Gamma}$ is [upper
    triangular]{.orange}, whereas the columns of the $n \times p$ matrix
    $\bm{Z}$ are [mutually orthogonal]{.blue}, due to the properties of the residuals of a linear model. 

-   It is often convenient to [standardize]{.orange} the columns of
    $\bm{Z}$, dividing them by their norm $||\bm{z}_j||$. Let
    $\bm{D} = \text{diag}(||\bm{z}_1||, \dots, ||\bm{z}_p||)$, then in
    matrix notation: $$
    \bm{X} = \bm{Z} \bm{\Gamma} = \bm{Z} \bm{D}^{-1} \bm{D} \bm{\Gamma} = \bm{Q} \bm{R}, \quad \text{with} \quad \bm{Q} = \bm{Z}\bm{D}^{-1}.
    $$

-   [Remark]{.orange}. Note that $\bm{Q}^T \bm{Q} = I_p$, i.e. the
    columns of $\bm{Q}$ are [orthonormal]{.blue}.
:::

## The QR decomposition II

::: callout-note
#### Theorem (QR factorization)

Suppose $\bm{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ with $n \ge p$ has full
rank, that is $\text{rk}(\bm{X}) = p$. Then, there exists a factorization
of the form $$
\bm{X} = \bm{Q} \bm{R},
$$ where $\bm{Q} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ has [orthonormal
columns]{.orange} and $\bm{R} \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$ is an [upper
triangular]{.blue} matrix.
:::

. . .

::: callout-tip
#### Corollary (QR factorization)

The QR decomposition is [unique]{.blue} up to [sign flips]{.blue} of the
columns of $\bm{Q}$ and the rows of $\bm{R}$. Moreover, if $\bm{R}$ has
positive diagonal entries, as the one obtained using Gram-Schmidt, then
it coincides with the [Cholesky factor]{.orange} of $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$.
:::

## The QR decomposition and least squares

::: incremental
-   The QR decomposition greatly facilitates computations for linear
    models. Indeed: $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \hat{\beta} &= (\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y} = [(\bm{Q}\bm{R})^T\bm{Q}\bm{R}]^{-1}(\bm{Q}\bm{R})^T\bm{y}\\
    &= (\bm{R}^T\bm{Q}^T\bm{Q}\bm{R})^{-1}\bm{R}^T\bm{Q}^T\bm{y} \\
    &= \bm{R}^{-1} (\bm{R}^T)^{-1} \bm{R}^T\bm{Q}^T\bm{y} \\
    &= \bm{R}^{-1}\bm{Q}^T \bm{y}.
    \end{aligned}
    $$

-   Hence, the least square estimate is obtained as the solution of the
    [triangular system]{.blue} $$
    \bm{R}\beta = \bm{Q}^T\bm{y},
    $$ which can be easily solved via [backward substitution]{.orange}.

-   As a special case of the above equation, one gets
    $\hat{\beta}_p = (\bm{z}_p^T\bm{y}) / (\bm{z}_p^T \bm{z}_p)$.
:::

## The QR decomposition and linear models

::: incremental
-   An important advantage of the QR factorization is that many other
    useful quantities can be readily computed. For example, the
    [covariance matrix]{.orange} is obtained as: $$
      s^2 (\bm{X}^T \bm{X})^{-1} = s^2 \bm{R}^{-1} (\bm{R}^{-1})^T.
      $$

-   The [predicted values]{.orange} and the [projection matrix]{.blue}
    are also easily obtained as $$
    \hat{\bm{y}} = \bm{H}\bm{y} = \bm{Q}\bm{Q}^T\bm{y}.
    $$

-   The diagonal elements $h_i = [\bm{H}]_{ii}$ of the hat matrix
    $\bm{H}$ are called [leverages]{.orange} and one may want to compute
    them without evaluating the full $n \times n$ matrix, using $$
    h_i = \sum_{j=1}^p q_{ij}^2, \qquad i=1,\dots,n,
    $$ where $q_{ij}$ are the entries of $\bm{Q}$.
:::

## Computational complexity

::: incremental
-   The solution via QR factorization is [numerically reliable]{.orange}
    and it facilitates the computation of other quantities of interest.

-   In practice, the QR is computed via a [modified
    Gram-Schmidt]{.blue}, that fixes the instabilities of the naïve
    Gram-Schmidt algorithm, or via [Householder reflections]{.orange}.

-   The expensive step is the QR factorization. The overall
    computational complexity is of order $$
    \sim 2 n p^2$$ which is about twice that of the Cholesky, when $n$
    is much larger than $p$, and about the same when $p \approx n$.

-   Depending on the context, and assuming we only care about $\hat{\beta}$, we may prefer the Cholesky ([fast]{.blue} but [imprecise]{.orange}) or the QR ([slower]{.orange} but more [reliable]{.blue}). 

- The default approach in R, i.e. the one implemented in the `lm`
    function, is the QR factorization, because one typically also needs to compute $\bm{H}$, or the leverages. 
:::

## ☠️ - Pivoting and rank deficiencies

::: incremental
-   If $\text{rk}(\bm{X}) = k < p$ ([rank deficiency]{.orange}) then it
    is still possibile to obtain a "QR" factorization of the form $$
    \bm{X}\bm{P} = \bm{Q}\begin{bmatrix}\bm{R}_{11} & \bm{R}_{12} \\
    0 & 0\end{bmatrix},
    $$ where $\bm{P}$ is a $p × p$ permutation matrix and $\bm{R}_{11}$
    is an $k \times k$ upper triangular and non-singular matrix.

-   This operation is sometimes called [pivoting]{.blue} and it is
    particularly important even when $\text{rk}(\bm{X}) = p$ to prevent
    numerical issues when the condition number $\kappa(\bm{X})$ is high.

-   In presence of perfect collinarity, the implementation of the QR
    decomposition in R (`qr`) relies on pivoting. This is why the `lm`
    function is able to automatically "omit" a predictor.
:::

# Iterative methods

## When $n$ is very large...

::: incremental
-   When the [sample size]{.blue} $n$ is [extremely large]{.orange}, as it is common in data
    mining problems, then the QR factorization can be computed.

-   Indeed, even [loading]{.orange} $\bm{X}$ into [memory]{.orange}
    could be problematic.

-   In the normal equations approach, we only need to compute the
    [sufficient statistics]{.blue}: $$
    \bm{W} = \bm{X}^T\bm{X}, \qquad \bm{u} = \bm{X}^T\bm{y},
    $$ which are of dimension $p\times p$ and $p \times 1$,
    respectively.

-   If we knew $\bm{W}$ and $\bm{u}$, then we could obtain the least square estimate
    $\hat{\beta}$ using the Cholesky factorization.

-   However, when $n$ is extremely large, the difficult part is indeed
    computing $\bm{W}$ and $\bm{u}$!
:::

## Recursive data import {#recursive-data-import}

::: incremental
-   Using matrix notation, we express $\bm{W} = \bm{W}_{(n)}$ and
    $\bm{u} = \bm{u}_{(n)}$ as follows $$
    \bm{W}_{(n)} = \sum_{i=1}^n \tilde{\bm{x}}_i \tilde{\bm{x}}_i^T, \qquad \bm{u}_{(n)} = \sum_{i=1}^n\tilde{\bm{x}}_i y_i.
    $$

-   Let us define the [initial conditions]{.blue}
    $\bm{W}_{(1)} = \tilde{\bm{x}}_1 \tilde{\bm{x}}_1^T$ and
    $\bm{u}_{(1)} = \tilde{\bm{x}}_1 y_1$.

-   Then, the following [recursive relationship]{.orange} holds: $$
    \bm{W}_{(i)} = \bm{W}_{(i-1)} +  \tilde{\bm{x}}_i \tilde{\bm{x}}_i^T, \qquad \bm{u}_{(i)} = \bm{u}_{(i-1)} + \tilde{\bm{x}}_i y_i, \qquad i=2,\dots,n,
    $$ where $\bm{W}_{(i)}$ is the matrix formed by the first $i$
    summands of $\bm{W}_{(n)}$ and analogously $\bm{u}_{(i)}$.

-   Hence $\bm{W}_{(n)}$ and $\bm{u}_{(n)}$ can be calculated by
    [importing a single record]{.blue} at a time, which does not create
    memory issues.
:::

## Recursive estimates

::: incremental
-   In many occasions, the data flow continuously, meaning that we get a
    new pair of observations $(\tilde{\bm{x}}_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$ every
    minute, or even every second.

-   In these cases, we would like to [update]{.orange} the current least square estimate
    $\hat{\beta}_{(n)}$ with the new information
    $(\tilde{\bm{x}}_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$, but ideally without re-doing all
    the calculations.

-   The [recursive data import]{.blue} of the [previous
    slide](#recursive-data-import) is partially unsatisfactory, because
    one would need to invert (or factorize) a $p \times p$ matrix every
    time, which could be costly.

-   Let us define some useful quantity: $$
    \bm{V}_{(n)} = \bm{W}_{(n)}^{-1} = (\bm{X}_{(n)}^T\bm{X}_{(n)})^{-1},
    $$ where $\bm{X}_{(n)}$ denotes the design matrix with $n$
    observations and analogously $\bm{y}_{(n)}$.
:::

## Sherman-Morrison formula

-   When the new data points arrive, we can write the updated quantities
    $$
    \bm{X}_{(n+1)} = (\bm{X}_{(n)}, \tilde{\bm{x}}_{(n + 1)})^T, \quad \bm{W}_{(n + 1)} = (\bm{X}_{(n+1)}^T\bm{X}_{(n + 1)}) = (\bm{X}_{(n)}^T\bm{X}_{(n)} +  \tilde{\bm{x}}_{(n + 1)} \tilde{\bm{x}}_{(n + 1)}^T).
    $$

-   The difficult part is to [efficiently]{.orange} compute
    $\bm{V}_{(n+1)} = \bm{W}_{(n + 1)}^{-1}$. The following result of
    linear algebra is of incredible help in this regard.

::: callout-note
#### Sherman-Morrison formula

Let $\bm{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{p\times p}$ be an invertible matrix and let
$\bm{b},\bm{d}$ be $p$-dimensional vectors. Then $$
(\bm{A} + \bm{b} \bm{d}^T)^{-1} = \bm{A}^{-1} - \frac{1}{1 + \bm{d}^T \bm{A}^{-1}\bm{b}}\bm{A}^{-1}\bm{b}\bm{d}^T\bm{A}^{-1}.
$$
:::

## The recursive least squares algorithm I

::: incremental
-   Using the Sherman-Morrison formula, then we can express the new
    matrix $\bm{V}_{(n + 1)}$ as a function of previously computed
    quantities: $$
    \bm{V}_{(n + 1)} = \bm{V}_{(n)} - v_{(n)}\bm{V}_{(n)} \tilde{\bm{x}}_{(n + 1)}\tilde{\bm{x}}_{(n + 1)}^T \bm{V}_{(n)}, \quad v_{(n)} = \frac{1}{(1 + \tilde{\bm{x}}_{(n + 1)}^T \bm{V}_{(n)}\tilde{\bm{x}}_{(n + 1)})}.
    $$

-   The [updated least square estimate]{.orange} therefore becomes $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \hat{\beta}_{(n+1)} &= \bm{V}_{(n + 1)}(\bm{X}_{(n)}^T\bm{y}_{(n)} +  \tilde{\bm{x}}_{(n + 1)} y_{n+1}) \\
    &=\hat{\beta}_{(n)} +  \underbrace{v_{(n)} \bm{V}_{(n)}\tilde{\bm{x}}_{(n + 1)}}_{k_n}\underbrace{(y_{n+1} - \tilde{\bm{x}}_{(n + 1)}^T\hat{\beta}_{(n)})}_{e_{n + 1}} \\
    &= \hat{\beta}_{(n)} + k_n e_{n+1}.
    \end{aligned}
    $$

-   The quantity $e_{n+1}$ is the [prediction error]{.blue} of $y_{n+1}$
    based on the previous estimate $\hat{\beta}_{(n)}$.
:::

## The recursive least squares algorithm II

-   The recursive estimation
    $\hat{\beta}_{(n+1)} = \hat{\beta}_{(n)} + k_n e_{n+1}$ takes the
    form of a [linear filter]{.orange}, in which the new estimate
    $\hat{\beta}_{(n+1)}$ is obtained by modifying the old one
    $\hat{\beta}_{(n+1)}$.

-   This is performed according to the [prediction error]{.blue}
    $\epsilon_{n+1}$ and the [gain]{.orange} $k_n$ of the filter.

-   Using a terminology typical of the machine learning field, we say
    that the estimator "learns from its errors".

-   If $n$ is sufficiently high, it is also possible to get an
    [approximate]{.orange} solution by initializing the algorithm by
    setting $\bm{V}_{(0)} = I_p$, to avoid any matrix inversion /
    factorization.

. . .

-   With further algebraic steps, we also obtain a [recursive
    formula]{.blue} for the [deviance]{.blue}

$$
||\bm{y}_{(n + 1)} - \bm{X}_{(n+1)}\hat{\beta}_{(n+1)}||^2 = ||\bm{y}_{(n + 1)} - \bm{X}_{(n)}\hat{\beta}_{(n)}||^2 + v_{(n)} e_{n+1}^2.
$$

-   The full algorithm is provided in A&S, Algorithm 2.2.
