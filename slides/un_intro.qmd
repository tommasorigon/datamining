## The Ames housing problem

![](https://datasciencebocconi.github.io/Images/ames_housing/housesbanner.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Suppose you are interested in [buying a new
    house]{style="color:DarkOrange"} in the town of Ames, which is
    located in the US state of Iowa.

-   You want to focus your search on houses that you expect to be able
    to afford.

-   Can you [predict]{style="color:DarkOrange"} the price of the house
    based on its characteristics?

-   This is a
    [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
    playground competition[^1]. You can join the competition, if you
    like. Keep in mind that the full dataset, including the test set, is
    public...

    Data as an End of Semester Regression Project." Journal of
    Statistics Education 19 (3).

## Problem description

-   This is a prediction problem, in which the **sale price** is the
    [output]{style="color:DarkOrange"} variable (response).

-   You have some information from all of the houses sold over the past
    few years, including the number of bedrooms, the size of the house,
    the year the house was built, etc.

-   This unit is organized into two sections:

    1.  We clean the data and perform some [exploratory data
        analysis]{style="color:DarkOrange"} to gain some preliminary
        understanding of the data;
    2.  We exploit advanced regression techniques to predict the price
        of the house using all the remaining
        [input]{style="color:DarkOrange"} variables (covariates).

-   In other words, we will try to estimate a function $f(\cdot)$ such
    that $$
    (\texttt{SalePrice}) = f(\texttt{GarageArea},\texttt{Neighborhood}, \dots) + \epsilon.
    $$
