-   We consider data for $n = 203$ models of cars in circulation in 1985
    in the USA.
-   We want to [predict]{.blue} the distance per unit of fuel as a
    function of the vehicle features.
-   We consider the following [variables]{.orange}:
    -   The city distance per unit of fuel (km/L, `city.distance`)
    -   The engine size (L, `engine.size`)
    -   The number of cylinders (`n.cylinders`)
    -   The curb weight (kg, `curb.weight`)
    -   The fuel type (gasoline or diesel, `fuel`).

-   Let us consider the variables `city.distance` ($y$), `engine.size`
    ($x$) and `fuel` ($z$).

-   A [simple linear regression]{.blue} $$
    Y_i = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x_i + \epsilon_i, \qquad i=1,\dots,n,
    $$ could be easily fit by least squares...

-   ... but the plot suggests that the relationship between
    `city.distance` and `engine.size` is [not]{.orange} well
    approximated by a [linear]{.orange} function.

-   ... and also that `fuel` has a non-negligible effect on the
    response.

## Regression models

::: incremental
-   A [general]{.orange} and [more flexible formulation]{.orange} for
    modeling the relationship between a vector of [fixed
    covariates]{.blue}
    $\bm{x}_i = (x_{i1},\dots,x_{ip})^T \in \mathbb{R}^p$ and a random
    variable $Y_i \in \mathbb{R}$ is $$
    Y_i = f(\bm{x}_i; \beta) + \epsilon_i, \qquad i=1,\dots,n,
    $$ where the "errors" $\epsilon_i$ are iid random variables, having
    zero mean and variance $\sigma^2$.

-   To estimate the unknown parameters $\beta$, a possibility is to rely
    on the [least squares criterion]{.blue}: we seek the
    [minimum]{.orange} of the objective function $$
    D(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n\{y_i - f(\bm{x}_i; \beta)\}^2,
    $$ using $n$ pairs of covariates
    $\bm{x}_i = (x_{i1},\dots,x_{ip})^T$ and the observed realizations
    $y_i$ of the random variables $Y_i$, for $i = 1,\dots,n$. The
    [optimal value]{.orange} is denoted by $\hat{\beta}$.

-   The [predicted values]{.blue} are
    $\hat{y}_i = \mathbb{E}(Y_i) = f(\bm{x}_i; \hat{\beta})$, for
    $i=1,\dots,n.$
:::

## Linear models

-   Let us consider again the variables `city.distance` ($y$),
    `engine.size` ($x$) and `fuel` ($z$).

-   Which function $f(x,z;\beta)$ should we choose?

. . .

-   A first attempt is to consider a [polynomial term]{.orange} combined
    with a [dummy variable]{.blue} $$
    f(x, z; \beta) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x + \beta_3 x^2 + \beta_4 x^3 + \beta_5 I(z = \texttt{gas}),
    $$ which is a special instance of [linear model]{.orange}.

. . .

::: callout-note
#### Definition (Linear model)

In a [linear model]{.blue} the response variable $Y_i$ is related to the
covariates through the function$$
    \mathbb{E}(Y_i) =f(\bm{x}_i; \beta) = \beta_1 x_{i1} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{ip} =\bm{x}_i^T\beta,
    $$ where $\bm{x}_i = (x_{i1},\dots,x_{ip})^T$ is a vector of
[covariates]{.orange} and $\beta = (\beta_1,\dots,\beta_p)^T$ is the
corresponding vector of [coefficients]{.orange}.
:::

## Matrix notation

-   The [response random variables]{.orange} are collected in the random
    vector $\bm{Y} = (Y_1,\dots,Y_n)^T$, whose [observed
    realization]{.blue} is $\bm{y} = (y_1,\dots,y_n)^T$.

-   The [design matrix]{.blue} is a $n \times p$ matrix, comprising the
    covariate's values, defined by $$
    \bm{X} = 
    \begin{bmatrix} 
    x_{11} & \cdots & x_{1p}\\
    \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    x_{n1} & \cdots & x_{np}
    \end{bmatrix}.
    $$

. . .

-   The $j$th variable (column) is denoted with $\tilde{\bm{x}}_j$,
    whereas the $i$th observation (row) is $\bm{x}_i$: $$
    \bm{X} = (\tilde{\bm{x}}_1,\dots,\tilde{\bm{x}}_p) = (\bm{x}_1, \dots,\bm{x}_n)^T.
    $$
    
. . .

-   Then, a [linear model]{.blue} can be written using the [compact
    notation]{.orange}: $$
    \bm{Y} = \bm{X}\beta + \bm{\epsilon},
    $$ where $\bm{\epsilon} = (\epsilon_1,\dots,\epsilon_n)^T$ is a
    vector of iid error terms with zero mean and variance $\sigma^2$.

## Linear regression: estimation I

-   The optimal set of coefficients $\hat{\beta}$ is the minimizer of
    the [least squared criterion]{.orange} $$
    D(\beta) = (\bm{y} - \bm{X}\beta)^T(\bm{y} - \bm{X}\beta) = ||\bm{y} - \bm{X}\beta||^2,
    $$ also known as [residual sum of squares (RSS)]{.orange}, where $$
    ||\bm{y}|| = \sqrt{y_1^2 + \cdots + y_n^2},$$ denotes the [Euclidean
    norm]{.blue}.

. . .

::: callout-note
#### Least square estimate (OLS)

If the design matrix has [full rank]{.blue}, that is, if
$\text{rk}(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}) = p$, then the [least square
estimate]{.orange} has an explicit solution: $$
    \hat{\beta} = (\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1}\bm{X}^T \bm{y}.
    $$
:::

## Linear regression: estimation II

-   In matrix notation, the predicted values can be obtained as $$
    \hat{\bm{y}} = \bm{X}\hat{\beta} = \bm{H}\bm{y}, \qquad \bm{H} = \bm{X}(\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1}\bm{X}^T.
    $$

-   $\bm{H}$ is a $n \times n$ [projection matrix]{.orange} matrix
    sometimes called [hat matrix]{.blue}.

-   It can be shown that $\text{tr}(\bm{H}) = \text{rk}(\bm{H}) = p$.
    Moreover, it holds $\bm{H} = \bm{H}^T$ and $\bm{H}^2 = \bm{H}$.

. . .

-   The quantity $D(\hat{\beta})$ is the so-called [deviance]{.blue},
    which is equal to $$
    D(\hat{\beta}) = ||\bm{y} - \hat{\bm{y}}||^2 = \bm{y}^T(I_n - \bm{H})\bm{y}.
    $$

-   Moreover, a typical estimate for the [residual variance]{.orange} $\sigma^2$
    is obtained as follows: $$
    s^2 = \frac{D(\hat{\beta})}{n - p} = \frac{1}{n-p}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \bm{x}_i^T\hat{\beta})^2.
    $$



## Linear regression: inference

-   Let us additionally assume that the errors follow a Gaussian
    distribution:
    $\epsilon_i \overset{\text{iid}}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2)$.

-   This implies that the [distribution]{.orange} of the
    [estimator]{.orange} $\hat{\beta}$ is $$
    \hat{\beta} \sim N_p(\beta, \sigma^2 (\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1}).
    $$

-   Hence, the estimator $\hat{\beta}$ is [unbiased]{.orange} and its
    [variance]{.blue} can be estimated by $$
    \widehat{\text{var}}(\hat{\beta}) = s^2 (\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1}.
    $$

-   The [standard errors]{.orange} of the components of $\hat{\beta}$ correspond
    to the square root of the diagonal of the above covariance matrix.

. . .

-   Confidence interval and Wald's tests can be obtained through
    classical inferential theory.

. . .

-   Ok, we are ready to get back to the original problem...

## Car data, a first model

-   Our first attempt for predicting `city.distance` ($y$) via
    `engine.size` ($x$) and `fuel` ($z$) is: $$
      f(x, z; \beta) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 x + \beta_3 x^2 + \beta_4 x^3 + \beta_5 I(z = \texttt{gas}).
      $$

-   Indeed, by looking at the plot of the data, it is plausible that we
    need a [polynomial]{.orange} of degree $3$ or $4$

-   It is also clear from the plot that `fuel` is a relevant variable.
    Categorical variables are [encoded]{.orange} using [indicator
    variables]{.blue}.

. . .

-   To evaluate the goodness of fit, we can calculate the [coefficient
    of determination]{.orange}: $$
    R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{(``Residual deviance'')}}{\text{(``Total deviance'')}} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \bar{y})^2}.
    $$


## A first model: estimated coefficients

-   We obtain the following [summary]{.orange} for the regression
    coefficients $\hat{\beta}$.

```

## Comments and criticisms

-   Is this a good model?

-   The overall fit [seems satisfactory]{.blue} at first glance,
    especially if we aim at predicting the urban distance of cars when
    average engine size (i.e., between $1.5L$ and $3L$).

. . .

-   However, the plot of the [residuals]{.orange}
    $r_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$ suggests that the homoscedasticity
    assumption, i.e. $\text{var}(\epsilon_i) = \sigma^2$, might be
    violated.

. . .

-   Also, this model is unsuitable for [extrapolation]{.orange}.
    Indeed:

    -   It has no grounding in physics or engineering, leading to
        difficulties when interpreting the trend and to
        paradoxical situations.
    -   For example, the curve of the set of gasoline cars shows a local
        minimum around $4.6 L$ and then rises again!

-   It is plausible that we can find a better one, so what's next?

## Linear models and non-linear patterns

-   A significant advantage of linear models is that they can describe
    non-linear relationships via [variable transformations]{.blue} such
    as polynomials, logarithms, etc.

. . .

-   This gives the statistician a lot of modeling flexibility. For
    instance, we could let: $$
    \log{Y_i} = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \log{x_i} + \beta_3 I(z_i = \texttt{gas}) + \epsilon_i, \qquad i=1,\dots,n.
    $$

. . .

-   This specification is [linear in the parameters]{.orange}, it fixes
    the domain issues, and it imposes a monotone relationship between
    engine size and consumption.

. . .

```{r}
#| output: false
m2 <- lm(log(city.distance) ~ I(log(engine.size)) + fuel, data = auto)
kable(tidy(m2, conf.int = FALSE), digits = 3)
```

|term                | estimate| std.error| statistic| p.value|
|:-------------------|--------:|---------:|---------:|-------:|
|`(Intercept)`         |    3.060|     0.047|    64.865|       0|
|`log(engine.size)` |   -0.682|     0.040|   -17.129|       0|
|`fuel_gas`             |   -0.278|     0.038|    -7.344|       0|

## Second model: fitted values

  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  scale_color_tableau(palette = "Color Blind") +
  xlab("Fitted values") +
  ylab("Residuals")
```

## Comments and criticisms

-   The [goodness of fit]{.blue} indices are the following:

```{r}
r.squared.original <- 1 - sum(mean((auto$city.distance - exp(predict(m2)))^2)) / sum(mean((auto$city.distance - mean(auto$city.distance))^2))
kable(data.frame(r.squared.original = r.squared.original, glance(m2)[c(1, 3, 10)]))
```

-   Do not mix [apple]{.blue} and [oranges]{.orange}! Compare $R^2$s
    only if they refer to the same scale!

. . .

-   This second model is [more parsimonious]{.blue}, and yet it reaches
    satisfactory predictive performance.

-   It is also more coherent with the nature of the data: the
    predictions cannot be negative, and the relationship between engine
    size and the consumption is monotone.

-   Yet, there is still some heteroscedasticity in the residuals --- is
    this is due to a missing covariate that has not been included in the
    model?

## A third model: additional variables

-   Let us consider [two additional variables]{.blue}: `curb.weight`
    ($w$) and `n.cylinders` ($v$).

-   A richer model, therefore, could be: $$
    \log{Y_i} = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \log{x_i} +  \beta_3 \log{w_i} + \beta_4 I(z_i = \texttt{gas}) + \beta_5 I(v_i = 2) + \epsilon_i,
      $$ for $i=1,\dots,n$. The estimates are:

. . .

```{r}
#| output: false
auto$cylinders2 <- factor(auto$n.cylinders == 2)
m3 <- lm(log(city.distance) ~ I(log(engine.size)) + I(log(curb.weight)) + fuel + cylinders2, data = auto)
kable(tidy(m3, conf.int = FALSE), digits = 3)
```

## A third model: graphical diagnostics

```{r}
#| fig-width: 7.8
#| fig-height: 4.55

  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  scale_color_tableau(palette = "Color Blind") +
  xlab("Fitted values") +
  ylab("Residuals")
```

## Comments and criticisms

-   The goodness of fit greatly [improved]{.blue}:

```{r}
r.squared.original <- 1 - sum(mean((auto$city.distance - exp(predict(m3)))^2)) / sum(mean((auto$city.distance - mean(auto$city.distance))^2))
kable(data.frame(r.squared.original = r.squared.original, glance(m3)[c(1, 3, 10)]))
```

-   In this third model, we handled the [outliers]{.orange}
    appearing in the residual plots, which it turns out are identified
    by the group of cars having 2 cylinders.

-   The diagnostic plots are also very much improved, although still not
    perfect.

-   The estimates are coherent with our expectations, based on common
    knowledge. Have a look at the textbook (A&S) for a detailed
    explanation of $\beta_4$!

-   The car dataset is available from the textbook (A&S) website:

    -   Dataset <http://azzalini.stat.unipd.it/Book-DM/auto.dat>
    -   Variable description

## A tour inside old-fashioned statistics


- The first part of the unit is a tour in the "old style" data modeling, the kind of culture that Leo Breiman so [heavily criticized]{.orange} in his 2001 *Statistical Science* paper.

. . .

- However, this dataset was sufficiently small, meaning it could be "manually" analyzed and modeled. We gained much [understanding]{.blue} by doing so. 

- Hence, these old tools should not be considered useless or irrelevant. 

. . .

- The second half of the unit will have an entirely different flavor, though. 

- Given the vast amount of data we now have, it makes sense to focus on [computations]{.orange} for fitting linear models.

- As we will see, the mathematical simplicity of linear models leads to extremely [fast computations]{.blue}, an important advantage in the era of big data. 

# Normal equations

## How to obtain the least squares estimate?

-   In B.Sc. courses, it is often suggested that the least square
    estimate should be computed using the formula $$
    \hat{\beta} = (\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1}\bm{X}^T \bm{y},
    $$ that is, using the R code `solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% y`.

-   This approach works reasonably well in many [simple cases]{.blue}.

. . .

-   Unfortunately, in more challenging scenarios, e.g., when we have a
    lot of data (large $n$) and correlated variables, the above code is
    -   [computationally inefficient]{.orange}
    -   [numerically inaccurate]{.blue}
-   The main computational bottleneck is the calculation of the inverse
    of $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$, which is very costly and often numerically
    unstable, especially when the predictors are almost collinear.

## The normal equations

-   The least square estimate is the solution of the system of equations
    ([normal equations]{.orange}):$$
    \bm{X}^T\bm{X} \beta = \bm{X}^T \bm{y}.
    $$

-   This system could be solved using
    `solve(crossprod(X), crossprod(X, y))`.

-   This avoids the explicit computation of $(\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1}$ and
    it is preferable compared to the "direct solution." However, it does
    not exploit the properties of the matrix $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$.

. . .

. . .

-   Recall (from your favorite linear algebra textbook) that a
    [symmetric]{.blue} matrix $\bm{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$ is
    [positive definite]{.orange} if and only if one of the following
    properties is satisfied
    -   The quadratic form $\bm{x}^T \bm{A} \bm{x} > 0$
        for all $\bm{x} \in \mathbb{R}^p$ such that
        $\bm{x} \neq 0$.
    -   The eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_p$ of $\bm{A}$ are all
        strictly positive.
-   We now describe a strategy to compute $\hat{\beta}$ that exploits
    the fact that $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ is [positive definite]{.orange},
    resulting in more [efficient computations]{.blue}.

## Cholesky factorization

::: callout-note
#### Proposition A.1

Suppose $\bm{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ with $n \ge p$ has full
rank, that is $\text{rk}(\bm{X}) = p$. Then, the matrix $$
\bm{X}^T\bm{X}
$$ is [symmetric]{.blue} and [positive definite]{.orange}.
:::

. . .

::: callout-warning
#### Theorem (Cholesky factorization)

Let $\bm{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$ be a symmetric and positive
definite matrix. Then, there exists a unique [upper triangular]{.orange}
$p \times p$ matrix $\bm{R}$ with positive entries such that $$
\bm{A} = \bm{R}^T\bm{R}.
$$
:::

## Cholesky factorization and least squares

::: incremental
-   The Cholesky factorization is incredibly helpful for computing least
    squares. Indeed:

-   Let $\bm{R}^T\bm{R}$ be the Cholesky factorization of the matrix
    $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$. Then, the [normal equations]{.orange} can be
    written as $$
    \bm{R}^T\bm{R} \beta = \bm{X}^T \bm{y}.
    $$ This system can now solved in [two steps]{.orange}:

-   [Step 1 (Forwardsolve)]{.blue}. Solve with respect to $\bm{z}$ the
    system of equations $$
    \bm{R}^T \bm{z} = \bm{X}^T \bm{y}.
    $$

-   [Step 2 (Backsolve)]{.blue}. Given $\bm{z}$, now solve with respect
    to $\beta$ the system of equations $$
    \bm{R} \beta = \bm{z}.
    $$

-   Why is this procedure computationally more efficient than the naïve
    solution?
:::

## Forward and backward substitutions

::: incremental
-   The key observation is that the solution of [triangular
    systems]{.blue} is computationally [straightforward]{.orange}.

-   As an example, consider the following $3 \times 3$ lower triangular
    system: $$
    \begin{bmatrix} 
    l_{11} & 0 & 0 \\
    l_{21} & l_{22} & 0 \\
    l_{31} & l_{32} & l_{33} \\
    \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3
    \end{bmatrix}.
    $$

-   The solution for $x_1,x_2,x_3$ can be found sequentially: $$
    x_1 = \frac{b_1}{l_{11}}, \qquad x_2 = \frac{b_2 -  l_{21}x_1}{l_{22}}, \qquad x_3 = \frac{b_3 - l_{31}x_1 - l_{32}x_2}{l_{33}}.
    $$

-   Finding the [inverse]{.orange} $\bm{R}^{-1}$ is simple, again
    because $\bm{R}$ is upper triangular. Also, note that $$
    (\bm{X}^T \bm{X})^{-1} = (\bm{R}^T \bm{R})^{-1} = \bm{R}^{-1} (\bm{R}^{-1})^T.
    $$
:::

## Computational complexity

::: incremental
-   The solution via Cholesky factorization is a [fast direct
    approach]{.blue} for finding $\hat{\beta}$.

-   The expensive steps are:

    -   The formation of the matrix $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ requires
        $\sim n p^2$ elementary operations
    -   The Cholesky factorization of $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ requires
        $\sim p^3 / 3$ elementary operations.

-   This gives an overall computational complexity of order $$
    \sim n p^2 + p^3 /3,
    $$ which corrects the typographical error of the A&S textbook.

-   This means, unfortunately, that in [high-dimensional]{.blue}
    settings (large $p$) computations become [very costly]{.orange},
    since the complexity is cubic in $p$.
:::

## Error propagation in normal equations

::: incremental
-   The normal equations method is typically [quicker]{.blue} than other
    algorithms, as it removes the dependency on $n$, but it is in
    general numerically more [unstable]{.orange}.

-   Consider, for example, the following matrix: $$
    \bm{X} = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 \\
    \epsilon & 0 \\
    0 & \epsilon \end{bmatrix},
    $$ for a small value $\epsilon > 0$. Then, we obtain that
    $$\bm{X}^T \bm{X} = \begin{bmatrix}1 + \epsilon^2& 1 \\
    1 & 1 + \epsilon^2 \end{bmatrix}.
    $$

-   The numerical computation of $\epsilon^2$ in $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$
    requires a higher precision compared to $\epsilon$, leading to
    numerical instabilities and/or a [loss in accuracy]{.orange}.
:::

## Condition numbers and normal equations

::: incremental
-   Suppose $\bm{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ with $n \ge p$ has full
    rank and singular values $d_1 \ge d_2 \ge \dots \ge d_p$. Then its
    [condition number]{.orange} is $$
    \kappa(\bm{X}) = ||\bm{X}|| \cdot ||\bm{X}^+|| = \frac{d_1}{d_p},
    $$ where $\bm{X}^+$ is the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse. Note that
    $\kappa(\bm{X}) \ge 1$.

-   If $\kappa(\bm{X})$ is small, the matrix $\bm{X}$ is [well
    conditioned]{.blue}. Otherwise, we say it is [ill
    conditioned]{.orange}.

-   The condition number determines how accurately we can solve linear
    systems.

-   An important fact is: $$
    \kappa(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}) = \kappa(\bm{X})^2, 
    $$ implying that there is an evident loss of numerical accuracy when
    using normal equations.
:::

# The QR decomposition

## Orthogonal predictors

-   Another approach for computing least squares is based on the notion
    of orthogonality.

. . .

-   If the [predictors]{.blue} were mutually [orthogonal]{.orange}, the
    problem would be much simpler.

-   In other words, consider a linear model of the form $$
    \bm{Y} = \bm{Z}\bm{\beta} + \bm{\epsilon},
    $$ where $\bm{Z} = (\tilde{\bm{z}}_1,\dots,\tilde{\bm{z}}_p)$.
    [Orthogonality]{.orange} means that
    $\bm{Z}^T\bm{Z} = \text{diag}(\tilde{\bm{z}}_1^T\tilde{\bm{z}}_1,\dots,\tilde{\bm{z}}_p^T\tilde{\bm{z}}_p)$.

. . .

::: callout-note
#### Proposition A.2. OLS with orthogonal predictors

The least square estimate
$\hat{\bm{\beta}} = (\hat{\beta}_1,\dots,\hat{\beta}_p)^T$ with
orthogonal predictors is $$
\hat{\beta}_j = \frac{\tilde{\bm{z}}_j^T\bm{y}}{\tilde{\bm{z}}_j^T\tilde{\bm{z}}_j}, \qquad j=1,\dots,p.
$$
:::

## Regression by successive orthogonalization

::: incremental
-   Clearly, the predictors of $\bm{X}$ are generally not orthogonal.
    Hence, we want to find a suitable transformation
    $\bm{Z} = \bm{X} \bm{\Gamma}^{-1}$ that [orthogonalize]{.blue} the
    [predictors]{.orange}.

-   Suppose, for example, that $p = 2$. We set [first orthogonal
    predictor]{.orange} $\tilde{\bm{z}}_1 = \tilde{\bm{x}}_1$.

-   We then consider the following [univariate]{.blue} regression
    problem $$
    \tilde{\bm{x}}_2 = \gamma \tilde{\bm{z}}_1 + \bm{\epsilon}, \qquad \text{which leads} \qquad \hat{\gamma} = \frac{\tilde{\bm{z}}_1^T\tilde{\bm{x}}_2}{\tilde{\bm{z}}_1^T\tilde{\bm{z}}_1}.
    $$

-   The [second orthogonal predictor]{.orange} is obtained as the
    [residual term]{.blue}: $$
    \tilde{\bm{z}}_2 = \tilde{\bm{x}}_2 - \hat{\gamma}\tilde{\bm{z}}_1.
    $$

-   The geometry of linear models guarantees that
    $\tilde{\bm{z}}_1^T\tilde{\bm{z}}_2 = 0$.
:::

## Gram-Schmidt algorithm

::: incremental
-   Let us now consider the [general case]{.orange}, valid for any value
    of $p$.

-   [Initialization]{.blue}. Set $\tilde{\bm{z}}_1 = \tilde{\bm{x}}_1$.

-   [For $j= 2,\dots,p$]{.blue}. Consider the regression problem with
    $j-1$ orthogonal predictors $$
    \tilde{\bm{x}}_j = \sum_{k=1}^{j-1}\gamma_{kj} \tilde{\bm{z}}_k + \bm{\epsilon}_j, \quad \text{which leads} \quad \hat{\gamma}_{kj} = \frac{\tilde{\bm{z}}_k^T\tilde{\bm{x}}_j}{\tilde{\bm{z}}_k^T\tilde{\bm{z}}_k}, \quad k=1,\dots,j-1,
    $$ Then, compute the new vector $\bm{z}_j$ as the
    [residual]{.orange} term $$
    \tilde{\bm{z}}_j = \tilde{\bm{x}}_j - \sum_{k=1}^{j-1}\hat{\gamma}_{kj} \tilde{\bm{z}}_k
    $$

-   The geometry of linear models guarantees [orthogonality]{.orange},
    that is $\tilde{\bm{z}}_j^T \tilde{\bm{z}}_{j'} = 0$ for any
    $j \neq j'$.
:::

## The QR decomposition I

::: incremental
-   By construction, the Gram-Schmidt algorithm produces the following
    decomposition $$
    \bm{X} = \bm{Z} \bm{\Gamma}, \qquad \bm{\Gamma} = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & \hat{\gamma}_{12} & \hat{\gamma}_{13} &\cdots & \hat{\gamma}_{1p} \\
    0 &  1 & \hat{\gamma}_{23} &\cdots & \hat{\gamma}_{2p} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots &\ddots & \vdots\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1
    \end{bmatrix}, \qquad \bm{Z} = (\tilde{\bm{z}}_1,\dots,\tilde{\bm{z}}_p).
    $$

-   The $p \times p$ matrix $\bm{\Gamma}$ is [upper
    triangular]{.orange}, whereas the columns of the $n \times p$ matrix
    $\bm{Z}$ are [mutually orthogonal]{.blue}, due to the properties of
    the residuals of a linear model.

-   It is often convenient to [standardize]{.orange} the columns of
    $\bm{Z}$, dividing them by their norm $||\tilde{\bm{z}}_j||$. Let
    $\bm{D} = \text{diag}(||\tilde{\bm{z}}_1||, \dots, ||\tilde{\bm{z}}_p||)$,
    then in matrix notation: $$
    \bm{X} = \bm{Z} \bm{\Gamma} = \bm{Z} \bm{D}^{-1} \bm{D} \bm{\Gamma} = \bm{Q} \bm{R}, \quad \text{with} \quad \bm{Q} = \bm{Z}\bm{D}^{-1}.
    $$

-   [Remark]{.orange}. Note that $\bm{Q}^T \bm{Q} = I_p$, i.e. the
    columns of $\bm{Q}$ are [orthonormal]{.blue}.
:::

## The QR decomposition II

::: callout-warning
#### Theorem (QR factorization)

Suppose $\bm{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ with $n \ge p$ has full
rank, that is $\text{rk}(\bm{X}) = p$. Then, there exists a
factorization of the form $$
\bm{X} = \bm{Q} \bm{R},
$$ where $\bm{Q} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ has [orthonormal
columns]{.orange} and $\bm{R} \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$ is an [upper
triangular]{.blue} matrix.
:::

. . .

::: callout-tip
#### Corollary (QR factorization)

The QR decomposition is [unique]{.blue} up to [sign flips]{.blue} of the
columns of $\bm{Q}$ and the rows of $\bm{R}$. Moreover, if $\bm{R}$ has
positive diagonal entries, as the one obtained using Gram-Schmidt, then
it coincides with the [Cholesky factor]{.orange} of $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$.
:::

## The QR decomposition and least squares

::: incremental
-   The QR decomposition greatly facilitates computations for linear
    models. Indeed: $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \hat{\beta} &= (\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y} = [(\bm{Q}\bm{R})^T\bm{Q}\bm{R}]^{-1}(\bm{Q}\bm{R})^T\bm{y}\\
    &= (\bm{R}^T\bm{Q}^T\bm{Q}\bm{R})^{-1}\bm{R}^T\bm{Q}^T\bm{y} \\
    &= \bm{R}^{-1} (\bm{R}^T)^{-1} \bm{R}^T\bm{Q}^T\bm{y} \\
    &= \bm{R}^{-1}\bm{Q}^T \bm{y}.
    \end{aligned}
    $$

-   Hence, the least square estimate is obtained as the solution of the
    [triangular system]{.blue} $$
    \bm{R}\beta = \bm{Q}^T\bm{y},
    $$ which can be easily solved via [backward substitution]{.orange}.

-   As a particular case of the above equation, one gets
    $\hat{\beta}_p = (\tilde{\bm{z}}_p^T\bm{y}) / (\tilde{\bm{z}}_p^T \tilde{\bm{z}}_p)$.
:::

## The QR decomposition and linear models

::: incremental
-   An important advantage of the QR factorization is that many other
    useful quantities can be readily computed. For example, the
    [covariance matrix]{.orange} is obtained as: $$
      s^2 (\bm{X}^T \bm{X})^{-1} = s^2 \bm{R}^{-1} (\bm{R}^{-1})^T.
      $$

-   The [predicted values]{.orange} and the [projection matrix]{.blue}
    are also easily obtained as $$
    \hat{\bm{y}} = \bm{H}\bm{y} = \bm{Q}\bm{Q}^T\bm{y}.
    $$

-   The diagonal elements $h_i = [\bm{H}]_{ii}$ of the hat matrix
    $\bm{H}$ are called [leverages]{.orange} and one may want to compute
    them without evaluating the full $n \times n$ matrix, using $$
    h_i = \sum_{j=1}^p q_{ij}^2, \qquad i=1,\dots,n,
    $$ where $q_{ij}$ are the entries of $\bm{Q}$.
:::

## Computational complexity

::: incremental
-   The solution via QR factorization is [numerically reliable]{.orange}
    and it facilitates the computation of other quantities of interest.

-   In practice, the QR is computed via a [modified
    Gram-Schmidt]{.blue}, that fixes the instabilities of the naïve
    Gram-Schmidt algorithm, or via [Householder reflections]{.orange}.

-   The expensive step is the QR factorization. The overall
    computational complexity is $$
    \sim 2 n p^2,$$ which is about twice that of the Cholesky, when $n$
    is much larger than $p$, and about the same when $p \approx n$.

-   Depending on the context and assuming we only care about
    $\hat{\beta}$, we may prefer the Cholesky ([fast]{.blue} but
    [imprecise]{.orange}) or the QR ([slower]{.orange} but more
    [reliable]{.blue}).

-   The default approach in R, i.e., the one implemented in the `lm`
    function is the QR factorization because one typically also needs
    to compute $\bm{H}$, or the leverages.
:::

## ☠️ - Pivoting and rank deficiencies

::: incremental
-   If $\text{rk}(\bm{X}) = k < p$ ([rank deficiency]{.orange}) then it
    is still possible to obtain a "QR" factorization of the form $$
    \bm{X}\bm{P} = \bm{Q}\begin{bmatrix}\bm{R}_{11} & \bm{R}_{12} \\
    0 & 0\end{bmatrix},
    $$ where $\bm{P}$ is a $p × p$ permutation matrix and $\bm{R}_{11}$
    is an $k \times k$ upper triangular and non-singular matrix.

-   This operation is sometimes called [pivoting]{.blue}, and it is
    particularly important even when $\text{rk}(\bm{X}) = p$ to prevent
    numerical issues when the condition number $\kappa(\bm{X})$ is high.

-   In the presence of perfect collinearity, the implementation of the QR
    decomposition in R (`qr`) relies on pivoting. This is why the `lm`
    function can automatically "omit" a predictor.
:::

# Iterative methods

## When $n$ is very large...

::: incremental
-   When the [sample size]{.blue} $n$ is [extremely large]{.orange}, as
    it is common in data mining problems, then the QR factorization
    cannot be computed.

-   Indeed, even [loading]{.orange} $\bm{X}$ into [memory]{.orange}
    could be problematic.

-   In the normal equations approach, we only need to compute the
    [sufficient statistics]{.blue}: $$
    \bm{W} = \bm{X}^T\bm{X}, \qquad \bm{u} = \bm{X}^T\bm{y},
    $$ which are of dimension $p\times p$ and $p \times 1$,
    respectively.

-   If we knew $\bm{W}$ and $\bm{u}$, then we could obtain the least
    square estimate $\hat{\beta}$ using the Cholesky factorization.

-   However, when $n$ is extremely large, the difficult part is indeed
    computing $\bm{W}$ and $\bm{u}$!
:::

## Recursive data import {#recursive-data-import}

::: incremental
-   Using matrix notation, we express $\bm{W} = \bm{W}_{(n)}$ and
    $\bm{u} = \bm{u}_{(n)}$ as follows $$
    \bm{W}_{(n)} = \sum_{i=1}^n \bm{x}_i \bm{x}_i^T, \qquad \bm{u}_{(n)} = \sum_{i=1}^n\bm{x}_i y_i.
    $$

-   Let us define the [initial conditions]{.blue}
    $\bm{W}_{(1)} = \bm{x}_1 \bm{x}_1^T$ and
    $\bm{u}_{(1)} = \bm{x}_1 y_1$.

-   Then, the following [recursive relationship]{.orange} holds: $$
    \bm{W}_{(i)} = \bm{W}_{(i-1)} +  \bm{x}_i \bm{x}_i^T, \qquad \bm{u}_{(i)} = \bm{u}_{(i-1)} + \bm{x}_i y_i, \qquad i=2,\dots,n,
    $$ where $\bm{W}_{(i)}$ is the matrix formed by the first $i$
    summands of $\bm{W}_{(n)}$ and analogously $\bm{u}_{(i)}$.

-   Hence $\bm{W}_{(n)}$ and $\bm{u}_{(n)}$ can be calculated by
    [importing a single record]{.blue} at a time, which does not create
    memory issues.
:::

## Recursive estimates

::: incremental
-   In many occasions, the data flows continuously, meaning that we get a
    new pair of observations $(\bm{x}_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$ every minute, or
    even every second.

-   In these cases, we would like to [update]{.orange} the current least
    square estimate $\hat{\beta}_{(n)}$ with the new information
    $(\bm{x}_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$, but ideally without re-doing all the
    calculations.

-   The [recursive data import]{.blue} of the [previous
    slide](#recursive-data-import) is partially unsatisfactory, because
    one would need to invert (or factorize) a $p \times p$ matrix every
    time, which could be costly.

-   Let us define some useful quantity: $$
    \bm{V}_{(n)} = \bm{W}_{(n)}^{-1} = (\bm{X}_{(n)}^T\bm{X}_{(n)})^{-1},
    $$ where $\bm{X}_{(n)}$ denotes the design matrix with $n$
    observations and analogously $\bm{y}_{(n)}$.
:::

## Sherman-Morrison formula

-   When the new data points arrive, we can write the updated quantities
    $$
    \bm{X}_{(n+1)} = (\bm{X}_{(n)}, \bm{x}_{n + 1})^T, \quad \bm{W}_{(n + 1)} = (\bm{X}_{(n+1)}^T\bm{X}_{(n + 1)}) = (\bm{X}_{(n)}^T\bm{X}_{(n)} +  \bm{x}_{n + 1} \bm{x}_{n + 1}^T).
    $$

-   The difficult part is to [efficiently]{.orange} compute
    $\bm{V}_{(n+1)} = \bm{W}_{(n + 1)}^{-1}$. The following result of
    linear algebra is of incredible help in this regard.

. . .

::: callout-warning
#### Sherman-Morrison formula

Let $\bm{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{p\times p}$ be an invertible matrix and let
$\bm{b},\bm{d}$ be $p$-dimensional vectors. Then $$
(\bm{A} + \bm{b} \bm{d}^T)^{-1} = \bm{A}^{-1} - \frac{1}{1 + \bm{d}^T \bm{A}^{-1}\bm{b}}\bm{A}^{-1}\bm{b}\bm{d}^T\bm{A}^{-1}.
$$
:::

## The recursive least squares algorithm I

::: incremental
-   Using the Sherman-Morrison formula, then we can express the new
    matrix $\bm{V}_{(n + 1)}$ as a function of previously computed
    quantities: $$
    \bm{V}_{(n + 1)} = \bm{V}_{(n)} - v_n\bm{V}_{(n)} \bm{x}_{n + 1}\bm{x}_{n + 1}^T \bm{V}_{(n)}, \quad v_n = \frac{1}{(1 + \bm{x}_{n + 1}^T \bm{V}_{(n)}\bm{x}_{n + 1})}.
    $$

-   The [updated least square estimate]{.orange} therefore becomes $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \hat{\beta}_{(n+1)} &= \bm{V}_{(n + 1)}(\bm{X}_{(n)}^T\bm{y}_{(n)} +  \bm{x}_{n + 1} y_{n+1}) \\
    &=\hat{\beta}_{(n)} +  \underbrace{v_n \bm{V}_{(n)}\bm{x}_{n + 1}}_{\bm{k}_n}\underbrace{(y_{n+1} - \bm{x}_{n + 1}^T\hat{\beta}_{(n)})}_{e_{n + 1}} \\
    &= \hat{\beta}_{(n)} + \bm{k}_n e_{n+1}.
    \end{aligned}
    $$

-   The quantity $e_{n+1}$ is the [prediction error]{.blue} of $y_{n+1}$
    based on the previous estimate $\hat{\beta}_{(n)}$.
:::

## The recursive least squares algorithm II

-   The recursive estimation
    $\hat{\beta}_{(n+1)} = \hat{\beta}_{(n)} + \bm{k}_n e_{n+1}$ takes the
    form of a [linear filter]{.orange}, in which the new estimate
    $\hat{\beta}_{(n+1)}$ is obtained by modifying the old one
    $\hat{\beta}_{(n+1)}$.

-   This is performed according to the [prediction error]{.blue}
    $\epsilon_{n+1}$ and the [gain]{.orange} $k_n$ of the filter.

-   Using a terminology typical of the machine learning field, we say
    that the estimator "learns from its errors."

-   If $n$ is sufficiently high, it is also possible to get an
    [approximate]{.orange} solution by initializing the algorithm by
    setting $\bm{V}_{(0)} = I_p$, to avoid any matrix inversion /
    factorization.

. . .

-   With further algebraic steps, we also obtain a [recursive
    formula]{.blue} for the [deviance]{.blue}

$$
||\bm{y}_{(n + 1)} - \bm{X}_{(n+1)}\hat{\beta}_{(n+1)}||^2 = ||\bm{y}_{(n)} - \bm{X}_{(n)}\hat{\beta}_{(n)}||^2 + v_n e_{n+1}^2.
$$

-   The complete algorithm is provided in A&S, Algorithm 2.2.

## Generalized linear models

-   If the outcome is binary, a count, or if the errors are
    heteroscedastic, then the Gaussian linear regression model might be
    inappropriate.

-   We let $Y_i$ be iid draws from an [exponentialy dispersion
    family]{.blue}, which includes the Binomial, the Poisson, and the
    Gaussian distribution as special cases.

-   The canonical statistical solution are [generalized linear
    models]{.orange}, which are usually taught in undergraduate courses
    (e.g. Statistica III). This is just a [short recap]{.orange}.

. . .

#### Generalized linear model (GLMs)

In a [generalized linear model]{.blue}, the response variable is related
to the covariates through: $$
\mathbb{E}(Y_i) = g\{f(\bm{x}_i; \beta)\} = g(\beta_1 x_{i1} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{ip}) = g(\bm{x}_i^T\beta),
$$ where $g^{-1}(\cdot)$ is the so-called [link function]{.orange}, which is
known and invertible.
:::

## Likelihood-based inference

::: incremental
-   Let $\pi(y; \bm{x}, \theta)$ be the [density]{.blue} associated to
    each $Y_i$. Here $\theta$ is a vector of parameters.

-   The [log-likelihood]{.orange} of a GLM is $$
    \ell(\theta) = \ell(\theta;\bm{y}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log{\pi(y_i; \bm{x}_i, \theta)} + c,
    $$ where $c$ is an additive constant not depending on $\beta$.

-   The [maximum likelihood estimate]{.orange} for the regression
    coefficients $\beta$ is $$
    \hat{\theta} = \arg\max_\theta \ell(\theta).
    $$

-   Standard errors, tests, and confidence intervals can be easily
    obtained from (derivatives of) the log-likelihood, as you have seen
    in undergraduate courses (e.g., Statistica II and III).

-   The aforementioned inferential results are often grounded on
    [asymptotic theory]{.orange} and [quadratic approximations]{.blue}
    of the log-likelihood.
:::

## Linear models with Gaussian errors

::: incremental
-   When $Y_i$ are Gaussian random variables, then the log-likelihood is
    $$
    \ell(\beta, \sigma^2) = -\frac{n}{2}\log{\sigma^2} - \frac{1}{\sigma^2}D(\beta),
    $$ where $D(\beta)$ is the same quantity we have [defined
    before](/#/linear-regression-estimation-i).

-   Hence, the [ordinary least squares]{.blue} estimate $\hat{\beta}$ is
    also the [maximum likelihood]{.orange} estimate. Indeed, the
    maximizer of the log-likelihood with respect to $\beta$ is also the
    minimizer of $D(\beta)$.

-   Instead, the maximum likelihood estimate for the variance is
    $\hat{\sigma}^2 = D(\hat{\beta}) / n$.

-   Note in addition that the log-likelihood, evaluated at its maximum,
    is $$
    -2 \ell(\hat{\beta},\hat{\sigma}^2) =  n \log\{D(\beta)/n\} + n,
    $$ a quantity that will turn useful in [Unit B](un_B.html).
:::

## Binary classification via logistic regression

::: incremental
-   The `heart` dataset presents a [classification]{.blue} problem, in
    which we assume that $$
    Y_i \overset{\text{ind}}{\sim} \text{Bern}\{p(\bm{x}_i; \beta)\}, \qquad i=1,\dots,n.
    $$

-   The [canonical link]{.blue} function $g(x) = e^x / (1 + e^{x})$
    leads to the GLM $$
    \mathbb{P}(Y_i = 1)= p(\bm{x}_i; \beta) = \frac{\exp\{f(\bm{x}_i; \beta)\}}{1 + \exp\{f(\bm{x}_i; \beta)\}} = \frac{\exp(\beta_1 x_{i1} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{ip})}{1 + \exp(\beta_1 x_{i1} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{ip})},
    $$ known as [logistic regression]{.orange}. Note that in this model
    $\mathbb{E}(Y_i) = \mathbb{P}(Y_i = 1)$.

-   After some algebra, it can be shown that the log-likelihood is $$
    \ell(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i (\bm{x}_i^T\beta) - \log\{1 + \exp(\bm{x}_i^T\beta)\}.
    $$

-   Moreover, the [predicted values]{.orange} $p(\bm{x}_i; \hat{\beta})$
    are [probabilities]{.blue} and they belong to $(0,1)$.
:::

## Iteratively re-weighted least squares I

::: incremental
-   Let us define the so-called [score function]{.blue}: $$
    \ell'(\beta) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta}\ell(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n\bm{x}_i \{y_i - p(\bm{x}_i; \beta)\}, \qquad 
    $$

-   Moreover, the so-called [observed information matrix]{.blue} is $$
    j(\beta) = - \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \beta\partial \beta^T}\ell(\beta) = -\sum_{i=1}^n \bm{x}_i\bm{x}_i^T w_i(\beta), \quad w_i(\beta) = p(\bm{x}_i; \beta)\{1 - p(\bm{x}_i; \beta)\}.
    $$

-   In [matrix notation]{.orange}, we will write $$
    \ell'(\beta) = \bm{X}^T(\bm{y} - \bm{p}), \qquad j(\beta) = \bm{X}^T\bm{W}\bm{X},
    $$ where $\bm{p} = (p(\bm{x}_1; \beta), \dots, p(\bm{x}_n; \beta))$
    and $\bm{W} = \text{diag}(w_1(\beta),\dots, w_n(\beta))$.

-   Unfortunately, a closed-form expression for $\hat{\beta}$, solving
    the [likelihood equations]{.blue} $\bm{X}^T(\bm{y} - \bm{p}) = 0$,
    is not available. We need to use [iterative algorithms]{.orange}.
:::

## Iteratively re-weighted least squares II

::: incremental
-   As you [may
    remember](https://tommasorigon.github.io/introR/lezioni/un_K.html#il-metodo-di-newton-raphson-i),
    in the Newton-Raphson [iterative method]{.orange} we consider a
    [quadratic approximation]{.blue} of the log-likelihood on $\beta_0$,
    so that: $$
    \ell(\beta) \approx \ell(\beta_0) + \ell'(\beta_0)^T(\beta - \beta_0) - \frac{1}{2}(\beta - \beta_0)^Tj(\beta)(\beta - \beta_0).
    $$

-   By maximizing the quadratic approximation, in logistic regression we
    get the update $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \beta^{\text{new}} &= \beta^{(\text{old})} + j(\beta^{\text{old}})^{-1}\ell'(\beta^{\text{old}}) = \beta^{(\text{old})} + (\bm{X}^T\bm{W}\bm{X})^{-1}\bm{X}^T(\bm{y} - \bm{p}) \\
    & = (\bm{X}^T\bm{W}\bm{X})^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{W}\bm{z},
    \end{aligned}
    $$ where
    $\bm{z} = \bm{X}\beta^{(\text{old})} + \bm{W}^{-1}(\bm{y} - \bm{p})$,
    which we [cycle repeatedly]{.orange} until [convergence]{.blue}.

-   This algorithm is sometimes called [iteratively re-weighted least
    squares]{.blue} (IRLS), because [each step]{.orange} can be seen as
    the solution of the weighted least squares problem $$
    \beta^{\text{new}} = \arg\min_\beta (\bm{z} - \bm{X}\beta)^T \bm{W}(\bm{z} - \bm{X}\beta).
    $$
:::

## Computational considerations

::: incremental
-   Each [step]{.orange} of the IRLS algorithm finds the solution of the
    likelihood equations $$
    (\bm{X}^T\bm{W}\bm{X})\beta = \bm{X}^T\bm{W}\bm{z}.
    $$

-   Once again, the Cholesky and the QR decomposition can be exploited to
    speed up computations. See Section 5.4 of Arnold et al. (2019) for
    further details.

-   It can be shown that $\beta = (0,\dots,0)^T$ is a good starting
    point for the initialization.

-   Unfortunately, the IRLS is [not]{.orange} guaranteed to
    [converge]{.orange} nor to increase the log-likelihood at every
    step, but there are easy fixes.

-   See this
    [tutorial](https://github.com/tommasorigon/logisticVB/blob/master/em_logistic_tutorial.md)
    for an example of the [failure]{.orange} of IRLS.

-   These considerations and the IRLS algorithm can be easily
    generalized to all GLMs.

    model using `heart` data.
  
- The coefficient of the variable `obesity` is [negative]{.orange}. Why do you think this is the case?

## Prediction and model assessment I

-   The [predicted probabilities]{.orange} $p(\bm{x}_i; \hat{\beta})$
    are often [thresholded]{.blue}, to obtain 0-1 predicted values,
    mostly useful for interpretative reasons $$
    \hat{y}_i = \mathbb{I}(p(\bm{x}_i; \hat{\beta}) > c), \qquad i=1,\dots,n
    $$ for some threshold $c$, which is [usually]{.orange} set equal to
    $1/2$.

-   We can then compare the responses with the predicted values using
    the [confusion matrix]{.blue}:

|                |                     |          |           |
|----------------|---------------------|----------|-----------|
|                | **Actual response** |          |           |
| **Prediction** | **0**               | **1**    | **Total** |
| **0**          | $n_{00}$            | $n_{01}$ | $n_{0.}$  |
| **1**          | $n_{10}$            | $n_{11}$ | $n_{1.}$  |
| **Total**      | $n_{.0}$            | $n_{.1}$ | $n$       |

## Prediction and model assessment II

-   In the `heart` dataset, using $c = 0.5$, we get the following
    [confusion matrix]{.blue}:

```{r}
p_hat <- predict(m1, type = "response")
y_hat <- p_hat > 0.5
tab <- addmargins(table(y_hat, heart$chd))
rownames(tab) <- c("Predicted 0", "Predicted 1", "Predicted total")
colnames(tab) <- c("Actual 0", "Actual 1", "Actual total")
kable(tab)
```

-   Hence, the [overall accuracy]{.orange} is $(255 + 82) / 462 \approx 0.72$.

. . .

- The [true positive rate]{.blue} ([specificity]{.orange}) is defined as
$$
\text{specificity} = 1 - \mathbb{P}(``\text{false positive}") \approx \frac{n_{00}}{n_{00} + n_{10}} = \frac{255}{255 + 47} = 0.844.
$$
- On the other hand, the [true negative rate]{.blue} ([sensitivity]{.orange}) is defined as
$$
\text{sensitivity} = 1 - \mathbb{P}(``\text{false negative}") \approx \frac{n_{11}}{n_{01} + n_{11}} = \frac{82}{72 + 82} = 0.532.
$$

## The ROC curve

```{r}
#| message: false
#| #| fig-width: 7.8
#| fig-height: 6.0
#| fig-align: center
library(pROC)
roc_heart <- roc(response = heart$chd, predictor = p_hat)
p <- ggroc(roc_heart, legacy.axes = TRUE) + ggtitle(paste("Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) - AUC: ", round(auc(roc_heart), 2))) + ylab("Sensitivity") + xlab("1 - specificity") + geom_segment(
  aes(x = 0, xend = 1, y = 0, yend = 1),
  color = "grey", linetype = "dashed"
) + theme_bw() + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 1 - 255 / (255 + 47)), linetype = "dotted") + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 0.5), linetype = "dotted")

p
```

## Other topics

- When the number of responses labels $K > 2$, we cannot use any more logistic regression.

- The natural extension is called [multinomial regression]{.orange}, in which we model the probabilities
$$
\mathbb{P}(Y_i = k) = p_k(\bm{x}_i,\beta), \qquad k=1,\dots,K,
$$
for example, using [multinomial logit]{.orange}. The ideas of GLMs can be easily borrowed.

- An alternative and straightforward approach is [linear discriminant analysis]{.blue}, which is based on Bayes theorem. 

- You can find these topics in the textbook A&S (2011), although you have likely seen these models in the previous courses.
