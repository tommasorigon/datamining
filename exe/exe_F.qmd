## Theoretical exercises

#### Exercise F.1 - Degrees of freedom of MARS

Given the data $y_i$ with mean $f(x_i)$ and variance $\sigma^2$ and a
fitting operation $\hat{y}_i = \hat{f}(x_i)$, let us define the
[effective degrees of freedom]{.blue} as
$1/\sigma^2\sum_{i=1}^n \text{cov}(Y_i, \hat{f}(x_i))$, as in the
slides.

Consider the estimate $\hat{f}(x_i)$ of a [MARS]{.orange}, using a set
of predictors $\tilde{\bm{x}}_1,\dots,\tilde{\bm{x}}_p$.

1.  Generate $n = 100$ observations with predictors
    $\tilde{\bm{x}}_1,\dots,\tilde{\bm{x}}_p$ as independent standard
    Gaussian variates and fix these values.

2.  Generate response values $y_i$ also as standard Gaussian
    ($\sigma^2 = 1$), independent of the predictors. 
    
3. Fit several MARS models using the `earth` R package and compare the final [number of basis
    functions]{.orange} of each model with the associated
    [effective degrees of freedom]{.blue}.  Do about 50 simulations of the response and average the results to get a decent Monte Carlo approximation of the degrees of freedom. 
    Perform this operation as a function of the following tuning parameters:

    i.  A sufficiently large grid of values for `nk`, the maximum
        number of terms to be included in the forward pass.

    ii. Different maximum degrees of MARS:  `degree = 1`, `degree = 2`, and `degree = 3`.

    iii. Different pruning strategies: `pmethod = "none"` (no pruning) and
        `pmethod = "backward"` (backward regression).
