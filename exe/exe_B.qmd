## Theoretical exercises

#### B.1 - Bias-variance decomposition

[Prove]{.orange} the bias-variance decomposition stated in [this slide](../slides/un_B.html#bias-variance-trade-off).

#### B.2 - Optimism

[Prove]{.orange} that, as stated in [this slide](../slides/un_B.html#optimism-ii), the optimism, defined as $$
    \text{Opt} = \mathbb{E}(\text{MSE}_\text{test}) - \mathbb{E}(\text{MSE}_\text{train}),
    $$
    can be equivalently expressed as $$
    \text{Opt} = \frac{2}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\text{cov}(Y_i, \hat{f}(\bm{x}_i)).
    $$
Refer also to Exercise 3.3 of the textbook A&S (2011), which is implicitly computing similar quantities.

#### B.3 - Leave-one-out

[Prove]{.orange} the leave-one-out formula for linear models stated in [this slide](../slides/un_B.html#leave-one-out-cross-validation). 

[Hint]{.blue}: many steps are similar to those needed for obtaining [recursive least squares]{.blue}. Begin the proof by applying Sherman-Morrison formula to $\hat{\beta}_{-i}$. 

#### B.4 - An estimator with minimal variance

Let us consider the inequality $\bm{A} \preccurlyeq \bm{B}$ between two squared matrices $\bm{A}$ and $\bm{B}$ of dimension $p \times p$. The symbol $\preccurlyeq$ means that $\bm{A} - \bm{B}$ is positive semi-definite. 

Assume the [true model]{.blue} for the data $(x_i, y_i)$ is [linear]{.blue}, therefore $\bm{Y} = \bm{X}\beta + \bm{\epsilon}$. Let us assume, as usual, that the errors $\epsilon_i$ are iid and $\mathbb{E}(\epsilon_i) = 0$, $\text{var}(\epsilon_i) = \sigma^2$.  

Let $\bm{V} = \sigma^2 (\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1}$ be the covariance matrix of the ordinary least squares estimator $\hat{\beta}_\text{ols}$ and let $\tilde{\bm{V}}$ be the covariance matrix of another [linear]{.blue} and [unbiased]{.orange} estimator $\tilde{\beta} = \bm{A}\bm{y}$.

[Prove]{.orange} that $\bm{V} \preccurlyeq \tilde{\bm{V}}$. Hence, does it make sense to look for other (linear) estimators for $\hat{\beta}$?

#### B.5 - Heteroscedastic errors

Let us consider a [regression]{.orange} problems in which $$
        Y_i = f(\bm{x}_i) + v(\bm{x}_i) \epsilon_i, \qquad \tilde{Y}_i = f(\bm{x}_i) + v(\bm{x}_i)\tilde{\epsilon}_i, \quad i=1,\dots,n,
      $$ where $\epsilon_i$ and $\tilde{\epsilon}_i$ are iid
    "[error]{.orange}" terms, with $\mathbb{E}(\epsilon_i)=0$ and
    $\text{var}(\epsilon_i)=\sigma^2$.

Due to the presence of the function $v(\bm{x}_i)$, the error terms $v(\bm{x}_i) \epsilon_i$ have zero mean but variance $\sigma^2v(\bm{x}_i)^2$. In other words, the errors are [heteroscedastic]{.blue}. 

## Practical exercises

#### B.4 - The `trawl` dataset

Consider the dataset `trawl` contained in the `sm` library. Implement a function that fit a [polynomial regression]{.blue} using `Score1` as response variable ($y$) and `Longitude` as input variable ($x$). Implement a procedure that selects the [optimal degree]{.orange} of the polynomial based on leave-one-out cross-validation.
