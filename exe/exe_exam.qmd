## Mock exam

This a mock exam of the course Data Mining. The actual exam will have a similar structure. The candidate has **3 hours** to complete the exam.

#### Question 1

The Sherman-Morrison lemma is provided below. Let $\bm{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{p\times p}$ be an invertible matrix and let
$\bm{b},\bm{d}$ be $p$-dimensional vectors. Then $$
(\bm{A} + \bm{b} \bm{d}^T)^{-1} = \bm{A}^{-1} - \frac{1}{1 + \bm{d}^T \bm{A}^{-1}\bm{b}}\bm{A}^{-1}\bm{b}\bm{d}^T\bm{A}^{-1}.
$$

Answer the following questions:

1. Express the least squares estimate $\hat{\beta}_{(n+1)}$ as a function of the new data point $(x_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$ and the previous estimate $\hat{\beta}_{(n)}$. 
2. [Prove]{.orange} the correctness of the recursive least squares formula you presented at the previous point, including all the necessary details; you may use the above Sherman-Morrison lemma, if appropriate.
3. In which circumstances such a recursive least square formula is beneficial? Discuss.

[Optional question (laude)]{.blue}:

4. Find a similar recursive formula for the ridge estimator.


#### Question 2

The ridge estimator $\hat{\beta}_\text{ridge}$ is the [minimizer]{.orange} of $$
    \sum_{i=1}^n(y_{i} - \bm{x}_{i}^T\beta)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p\beta_j^2 = ||\bm{y} - \bm{X}\beta||^2 + \lambda ||\beta||^2,
    $$ where $\lambda > 0$.

Answer the following questions:

1. Present an analytic expression for $\hat{\beta}_\text{ridge}$. 
2. [Prove]{.orange} that such an analytic expression for $\hat{\beta}_\text{ridge}$ is indeed the minimizer of the above penalized loss function. Is it unique?
3. Discuss the role of $\lambda$. What does it happen when $\lambda \rightarrow 0$?


#### Question 3

The optimism is defined as $\text{Opt} = \mathbb{E}(\text{MSE}_\text{test}) - \mathbb{E}(\text{MSE}_\text{train})$. Answer to the following questions:

1. Prove that $\text{Opt} = (2 / n)\sum_{i=1}^n\text{cov}(Y_i, \hat{f}(\bm{x}_i))$. 
2. Specialize the previous formula of the optimism for linear models and linear smoothers. Include all the intermediate steps. 
3. Discuss the usefulness of such formulas in nonparametric regression. 

#### Question 4

Discuss differences and similarities between regression splines and smoothing splines.
