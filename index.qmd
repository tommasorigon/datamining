## Exam

#### Rules

The exam is made of [two parts]{.orange}:

- (20 / 30) [Written examination]{.blue}: a pen-and-paper exam about the theoretical aspects of the course.

- (10 / 30) [Individual assignment]{.blue}: a data challenge. 
   - You will be given a prediction task, and you will need to submit your [predictions]{.orange} and produce a [report]{.orange} of maximum 4 pages;
   - You will make use of the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) platform ([optional]{.blue});
   - Further info will be provided in due time.
  
Both parts are [mandatory]{.orange}, and you need to submit the assignment [before]{.orange} attempting the written part. The report expires after one year from the end of the course. The final grade is obtained as the [sum]{.blue} of the above scores. 

#### Past written examinations

| Date | Exam |
|------|------|
| 18 November 2025  | [Exam](exams/2025_11_18.html) |
| -    | [Mock exam](exe/exe_exam.html) |

## Prerequisites

Knowledge of the topics (i) linear algebra, (ii) linear models, and
(iii) generalized linear models (GLMs), is highly recommended.

Knowledge of topics covered in the courses Probability and Statistics M
and Advanced Statistics M is also highly recommended.

## Acknowledgments

The primary source of this website's content are the textbooks [Azzalini and Scarpa (2011)]{.blue} and [Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009)]{.orange}. A few pictures have been taken from the textbooks; in these cases the original source is cited. 

I have made use of several other books, scientific articles, and datasets to complement the main textbooks. They are all cited at the end of each unit. Students are encouraged to consult the books: these slides are just a concise summary. 

I am also grateful to Aldo Solari, who gracefully shared the material of the courses [Data Mining](https://aldosolari.github.io/DM/) and [Statistical Learning](https://aldosolari.github.io/SL/). These websites have been used to lay the basis of this course.

All the mistakes still present are mine.
